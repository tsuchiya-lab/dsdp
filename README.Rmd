The goal of `dsdp` is to estimate probability density
functions from a data set using a maximum likelihood method.
The models of density functions in use are familiar Gaussian 
or exponential distributions with polynomial correction terms.
To find an optimal model, we adopt a grid search for parameters of base functions
and degrees of polynomials,
together with semidefinite programming for coefficients of polynomials, and
then model selection is done by Akaike Information Criterion.

## Installation

```r
## Install from CRAN
install.packages(dsdp)
```

You can install the development version of `dsdp` from this repository:
```r
## Install from github
devtools::install_github("tsuchiya-lab/dsdp")
```
To install from source codes, the user needs an appropriate compiler toolchain,
for example, rtools in Windows, to build `dsdp`, along with `devtools` package.

## Usage
Please refer to the tutorial and the reference in 
[tsuchiya-lab.github.io/dsdp/](https://tsuchiya-lab.github.io/dsdp/).
