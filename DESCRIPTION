Description: The models of probability density functions are Gaussian or
    exponential distributions with polynomial correction terms.
    Using a maximum likelihood method, 'dsdp' computes parameters of Gaussian
    or exponential distributions together with degrees of polynomials by
    a grid search, and coefficient of polynomials by a variant of semidefinite
    programming. It adopts Akaike Information Criterion for model selection.
