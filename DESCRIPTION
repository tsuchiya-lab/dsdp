Description: Density estimation with Semidefinite Programming.
    The models of probability density functions are Gaussian or exponential
    distributions with polynomial correction terms. Using a maximum likelihood
    method, it computes parameters of Gaussian or exponential distributions
    together with degrees of polynomials by a grid search, and coefficients
    of polynomials by a variant of semidefinite programming.
    It adopts Akaike Information Criterion for model selection.
